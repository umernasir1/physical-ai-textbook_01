# Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This textbook provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Physical AI systems and humanoid robotics. We bridge the gap between digital intelligence and the physical world, enabling students to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four main modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2, including middleware for robot control, nodes, topics, services, Python agent integration, and URDF for humanoid modeling.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Dive into physics simulation and environment building. Explore high-fidelity rendering, human-robot interaction in Unity, and simulating sensors like LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
Discover advanced perception and training techniques, NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation, Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM and navigation, and Nav2 for bipedal humanoid movement.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Understand the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Robotics. Explore voice-to-action systems using OpenAI Whisper, cognitive planning for translating natural language into robot actions, and a capstone project on autonomous humanoids.

We are excited to embark on this journey with you to explore the fascinating world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics!
