## Prompt

Ensure the specification is organized, clear, and detailed, following the Constitution’s principles, objectives, scope, roles, and workflow rules. Structure it in a way that a development team can implement the project efficiently

## Response snapshot

I have received and incorporated the instruction to ensure all future specifications are organized, clear, detailed, and strictly follow the project's Constitution. I will structure them for efficient implementation by a development team.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Reinforced the quality standards for specification documents, ensuring they align with the project's foundational constitution.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a configuration/instructional prompt.
- 📁 Files: No files were modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to create a specification based on these enhanced guidelines.
- 🧠 Reflection: This prompt adds another layer of validation to my process. Before generating a spec, I will now also mentally cross-reference the project constitution to ensure alignment.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
