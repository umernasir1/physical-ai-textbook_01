# Research & Decisions for System Specification

## Technology Stack

### Decision
The technology stack for this project is as follows:
- **Frontend (Book):** Docusaurus
- **Backend (Chatbot):** FastAPI (Python)
- **Vector Database:** Qdrant Cloud
- **Relational Database:** Neon Serverless Postgres
- **AI/LLM Integration:** OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs

### Rationale
These technologies were not chosen based on research or comparison of alternatives. They are **explicitly mandated** by the `Hackathon.pdf` requirements. The primary goal of this project is to successfully build a solution with the specified stack.

### Alternatives Considered
No alternatives were considered, as adherence to the prescribed stack is a core evaluation criterion of the hackathon.
