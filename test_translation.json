  "content": "Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook\n\nThis textbook provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Physical AI systems and humanoid robotics. We bridge the gap between digital intelligence and the physical world, enabling students to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions.\n\nCourse Overview\nThis course is structured into four main modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics:\n\nModule 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)\nLearn the fundamentals of ROS 2, including middleware for robot control, nodes, topics, services, Python agent integration, and URDF for humanoid modeling.\n\nModule 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)\nDive into physics simulation and environment building. Explore high-fidelity rendering, human-robot interaction in Unity, and simulating sensors like LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.\n\nModule 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)",
